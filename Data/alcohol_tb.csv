Of all the effects, the peat's most drastic impact is on the nose.

Sweet, warm, buttery chocolate pastry notes (think: glistening croissant) open up on the palate, but the bright saline smoke rushes in close behind, halting the milk chocolate and candy pineapple flavors from evolving further.The phenolic peat essence hangs in the peppery finish, illuminating all the other flavors, but cutting off direct access to them.

5095,whiskey,"anCnoc // Highlands, Scotland",24 years,5,46.0,"""This distillery tends to release whiskies that are dense and creamy, and this rather mature dram is of course no exception. The sherry cask adds just the right touch of cashew and marmalade to classic toffee, caramel and vanilla. Warm spices ride it out into the finish, which is somewhat drying, but still satisfying. For a whisky of this maturity and depth, that price is a total steal.""",92,"{""smoky"":0,""peaty"":0,""spicy"":30,""herbal"":0,""oily"":15,""full_bodied"":80,""rich"":85,""sweet"":75,""briny"":0,""salty"":0,""vanilla"":40,""tart"":0,""fruity"":40,""floral"":5}",4.29

5098,whiskey,"anCnoc // Highlands , Scotland",NAS ,3,46.0,"""Grassy gold in color and whimsically peaty on the nose. Rascan opens up with hints of stone and earth. On the palate you find layered whisps of peat smoke, honeysuckle, vanilla, a hint of leather and salt. A light, lingering finish leaves you wanting another sip. You'll find this a pleasant introduction to peat if you haven't delved into it much or a pleasant reprieve if you love peaty whiskies and are looking for something light-hearted for an afternoon pep in your step.
