Sweet, warm, buttery chocolate pastry notes (think: glistening croissant) open up on the palate, but the bright saline smoke rushes in close behind, halting the milk chocolate and candy pineapple flavors from evolving further.The phenolic peat essence hangs in the peppery finish, illuminating all the other flavors, but cutting off direct access to them.

Lots of cereal grains and ginger on the nose as well as on the palate along with some secondary flavors of peach, pear, and brine. A textural and mineral finish makes for a whisky that was overall a very pleasant surprise.
